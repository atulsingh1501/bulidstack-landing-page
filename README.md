## 📌 Project Overview
DigitUX is a modern, responsive landing page for a digital agency. This project was built to practice pixel-perfect design-to-code conversion, focusing on:

- **Modern UI**: Uses CSS styling for complex shapes (hexagons), floating elements, and gradients.
- **Clean Code**: Semantic HTML5, organized CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
